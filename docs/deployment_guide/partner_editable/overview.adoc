This Partner Solution deploys a {partner-product-long-name} on the AWS Cloud. This guide covers the steps necessary to deploy this Partner Solution.

{partner-product-short-name} is an open source tool built for testing AWS CloudFormation templates. {partner-product-short-name} tests your CloudFormation template by deploying it in one or more specified AWS Regions simultaneously in one or more input parameter configurations, and then generates a report afterward with a pass/fail grade for each test. TaskCat is implemented in Python and is available in two formats: as a https://pypi.org/project/taskcat/[pip module] and in a https://hub.docker.com/r/taskcat/taskcat[Docker container].

NOTE: {partner-product-short-name} was originally developed by the AWS Integration & Automation team as an internal tool for automatically testing AWS CloudFormation templates, but has since been released as open source.
