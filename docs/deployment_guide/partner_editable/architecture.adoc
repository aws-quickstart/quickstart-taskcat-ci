image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this AWS Solution sets up the following:

* CodePipeline to automate a CI/CD pipeline with source, build/test, and deploy stages.
* AWS CodeBuild to retrieve pipeline artifacts from an Amazon S3 bucket and run TaskCat.
* TaskCat to deploy and test CloudFormation templates and save a report of test results to an S3 bucket.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials used by CodeBuild for Git access
* Two S3 buckets, one for pipeline artifacts and another for TaskCat reports.
* An AWS Lambda function to merge tested code with the release branch in the GitHub repository.

=== Pipeline workflow

The deployment of the CI/CD pipeline for AWS CloudFormation templates requires two branches in the GitHub repository: a source branch and a release branch. The source branch is actively used for development and needs to be tested for any code changes. The release branch contains the stable code that has been tested successfully.

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three stages:

. **Source stage**: When a commit is made into the source branch, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline. In the source stage of the pipeline, the entire contents of the GitHub repository are pulled, zipped, and stored in an S3 bucket. The successful completion of the source stage triggers the build/test stage.
. **Build/test stage**: CodeBuild creates a Linux container, installs TaskCat and its dependencies in the container, downloads the zipped file that contains the source code from the S3 bucket, unpacks it, and runs tests using TaskCat. When the tests are completed, the report generated by TaskCat is uploaded to the S3 bucket. If the tests are successful, the deploy stage is triggered; otherwise, the build is marked as failed and the pipeline stops.
. **Deploy stage**: CodePipeline runs a Lambda function that merges the source branch of the GitHub repository into the release branch. The code is now ready to deploy from the GitHub repository. Additionally, you can use AWS CodeDeploy and/or add your own scripts to deploy your software post&#8209;merge.
