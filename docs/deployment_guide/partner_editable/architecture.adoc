image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this AWS Solution sets up the following:

* AWS CodePipeline to automate a CI/CD pipeline with source, build/test, and deploy stages.
* In the source stage, a Git user pushes a commit, which invokes CodePipeline. CodePipeline retrieves source code and stores it in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) artifacts bucket.
* In the build/test stage:
** AWS CodeBuild retrieves code from an artifacts S3 bucket and runs TaskCat.
** TaskCat deploys and tests CloudFormation templates and saves test results to a reports S3 bucket.
** AWS Secrets Manager stores credentials used by CodeBuild for Git access.
* In the deploy stage, a Lambda function merges tested code with the release branch in the GitHub repository.
